i've created this project for a college assignment to create something impactful for the enviroment based on the [2030 agenda for sustainable development from United Nations] (https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n15/291/89/pdf/n1529189.pdf)

it was made to work on the webui from Lexmark's MX711de and MX611dhe printers

it calculates the paper used, the impacts of the printed papers on the enviroment based on [Paper Calculator](https://c.environmentalpaper.org/) calculus from Environmental Paper Network and pushes inside a time-based MongoDB database
